# **Create your KNIME Nodes using Python** 


Welcome to the KNIME Extension-Example! 

With this repoistry, we showcase an example on how a KNIME node can be developed using Python. We build the KNIME node called "**Geo Distances**" using this repo. This node computes the distance between two locations using their GPS coordinates.   

To get a detailed explanation how KNIME nodes can be built using Python, please read the blog post.
